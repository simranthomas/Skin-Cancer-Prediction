# Skin-Cancer-Prediction

## Motivation
Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer that is caused by abnormal reproduction of melanocyte cells. Early diagnosis of melanoma is a key factor for the prognosis of the disease. But it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as it requires biopsy of the skin i.e. a part of the skin needs to be extracted and diagnosed in order to detect the cancer. Hence, there is a need for a system in order to aid physicians for the classification of melanoma as cancerous or noncancerous. The implemented systems aims at avoiding biopsy as it is a very painful process. Here, we make use of technology to predict whether a skin lesion is benign or malign.
